class CheckedCircuits:
    """Internal data container holding every variant produced by a single
    ``pick_checks`` run -- the bare circuit followed by one circuit per
    committed check.

    Attributes:
        circuits: List of ``QuantumCircuit``s; ``circuits[k]`` has the first
            ``k`` checks committed (``circuits[0]`` is the bare payload).
        check_qubits: Qubit indices of the ancillas (one per committed check).
        virtual_zs: For each committed check, the list of qubit indices whose
            Z-basis outcomes XOR together to give that check's syndrome bit.
        costs: Picker-metric values, one per variant; ``costs[k]`` is the
            metric after committing the first ``k`` checks. Length is
            ``len(check_qubits) + 1``.
        committed_targets: The target qubits that actually received a check, in
            commit order. May be a subsequence of the requested targets when
            some have no valid check (e.g. too-shallow wires).

    This class is internal; the public-facing ``CheckedCircuit`` (singular)
    in ``qiskit_paulice.checked_circuit`` is what users see.
